- Provide examples or mockups if possible

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the project's coding standards:
   - Use TypeScript
   - Follow existing code style
   - Write clear, self-documenting code
   - Avoid unnecessary comments

3. **Test your changes**:

   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

   Ensure all tests pass before submitting.

4. **Commit your changes**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of changes"
   ```

   Use clear, descriptive commit messages.

5. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request** using the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

## Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/haalarikone.git
   cd haalarikone
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (see [README.md](./README.md#3-environment-variables))

4. **Start the development server**:

   pnpm run dev
   ```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode (already configured)
- Define proper types for all functions and components
- Avoid `any` types when possible

### Code Style

- **No comments** unless explicitly necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Component Guidelines

- Use functional components
- Prefer server components (Next.js App Router)
- Mark client components with `"use client"`
- Use path aliases (`@/`) for imports
- Keep components small and reusable

### Git Commit Messages

Use conventional commits-style prefixes:

- **feat:** new feature or user-facing enhancement
- **fix:** bug fix
- **chore:** tooling or dependency updates
- **docs:** documentation-only changes
- **refactor:** code refactors without behavior changes
- **test:** add or update tests

Example:

```
feat: add advanced search filters
fix: correct auth redirect loop
docs: clarify environment setup
```

## Testing

- Write tests for new features when applicable
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you've changed functionality
2. **Add tests** for new features or bug fixes
3. **Ensure all tests pass** locally
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** if applicable (if the project uses one)
5. **Request review** from maintainers
