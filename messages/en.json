    "q2": "What are the most popular overall colors?",

    "q3": "How are overall colors chosen in student organizations?",
    "a3": "Overall colors are usually chosen jointly between student organizations and institutions. Each field and university may have its own traditions and rules for choosing overall colors.",
    "q4": "Are university and UAS overall colors the same?",
    "a4": "No, overall colors vary significantly between universities and UAS. UAS and universities usually have their own overall colors, even if the field is the same. Also, overall colors of the same institution can vary in different areas.",
    "q5": "What is the significance of overall colors in student culture?",
    "a5": "Overall colors are an important part of Finnish student culture. They help identify a student's field and institution, and create community among students. Overall colors are especially visible at student events and May Day celebrations.",
    "q6": "Can overall colors change?",
    "a6": "Overall colors can change over time when student organizations decide to change colors. This is relatively rare, but not impossible. Overall Machine updates overall colors regularly."
